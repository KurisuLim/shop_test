## Shop Test
* This python program uses List that prints out the inventory of the shop.
* And at the same time it will check the length, index the list, slice
* as well as delete and adding a new items on the list.

## The Purpose
* I am creating this program to have a good understanding on what I should do,
* when I am about to implement a shop feature in my text rpg.
